Math Class built in methods:-

# For this Maths class no need to import any package

  1: for getting pi value, we can use
      Math.PI; 
        --> it gives a value of 3.141592653589793 which is a double value
  2: there is also for Exponential value e Euler number
      Math.E;
        --> it gives a value of 2.718281828459045 which is also a double value
  3: to find the value of power of a value 
      Math.pow(2,3); 
        --> 2^3 is the meaning
  4: to find the absolute value of a number 
      Math.abs(-3); 
        --> it gives 3, becomes absolute value
  5: to find the square root of a value
      Math.sqrt(3);
        --> it gives square root for the value 3
  6: to get a roundoff value 
      Math.round(3.14); // output: 3
        --> it gives nearest roundoff value of given value
  7: to get always the heighest roundoff value we should use ceil
      Math.ceil(3.14); // output: 4
        --> to get the heighest value all time 
  8: to get always the lowest value while roundoff
      Math.floor(3.99); // output: 3
        --> always it says lowest roundoff value
  9: to get a maximum value between them
      Math.max(10,20); // output: 20
        --> compare and gives the maximum value
  10: to get the minimum value between two numbers or variables
      Math.min(2,8); // output: 2
        --> compare and give the minimum value
