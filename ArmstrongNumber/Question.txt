Write a Java program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number or not.

Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input number: 153
Output: "Yes, the number is an Armstrong number."

Armstrong number means 
  --> take a number 
  --> find its digits, how many digits are there in the number
  --> now power the value of digits with each number in a number of each place
  --> now add all the value 
  --> if sum is equal to the number in the beginning then the number is a armstrong number
 eg: 153
 it has 3 digit
 so 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3  = 153
 it's equal to the value, so it is a armstrong number.
